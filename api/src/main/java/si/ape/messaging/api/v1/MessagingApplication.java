// This file is empty but not removed, due to it probably being necessary in the build system. As we are not using a
// REST api in this microservice, we do not need this to be the entry point of the application. Rather, the
// MessagingServiceImpl class is the entry point of the application, as it is the class that implements the gRPC service
// interface.
